# Exercise0401 ADO.NET
Implementation of basic CRUD operations in a Data Access Layer

You are working as a software developer. Your team is developing an application that can manage a customer database and your task is to implement the operations in the data access layer (DAL). 

You find the application code in this repository so you will need to clone or download it by clicking the *Clone or download* button.

There are five methods that you should implement:
1. Get()
1. GetAll()
1. Insert()
1. Update()
1. Delete()

**HINT!** The methods that you must implement are marked with a *TODO* comment
